# TruthLens
TruthLens is a web-based Scientific Consensus Engine that evaluates user-submitted claims using an academic-style evidence synthesis approach. It analyzes research sources, weighs credibility by citations, recency, and study type, and generates a quantified consensus score to help users assess evidence strength and misinformation risk.
You can see the project in master branch.
